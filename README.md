# Great iOS Developer Task

This repository contains a sample iOS application developed as part of the "Great iOS Developer" task. The app features a 2-screen interface: a Login screen and a Server List screen, designed to meet the provided technical requirements and closely replicate the design from the Figma file.

## Overview

- Login Screen: Allows users to log in using predefined credentials to obtain an authorization token.
- Server List Screen: Displays a list of servers fetched after successful login, with persistent storage and sorting options.
- Credential Storage: Optional implementation using Keychain for seamless app restarts.
- Networking: Handles API requests to authenticate and fetch server data.
- Persistence: Uses SwiftData for storing server information.
- Testing: Includes unit and integration tests for core functionality.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… SwiftUI-based UI
- âœ… MVVM architecture
- âœ… Modular project structure
- âœ… Swift Concurrency (async/await)
- âœ… Dependency Injection
- âœ… Unit-tested core services
- âœ… Biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID)
- âœ… Figma design integration

## Project Structure

- `AppConfigurator.swift`: Centralizes constants for sizes, images, URLs, strings, colors, and fonts.
- `LoginView.swift`: Implements the login screen with an animated logo and form.
- `LoginViewModel.swift`: Manages login logic and authentication.
- `ServersView.swift`: Displays the server list with sorting capabilities.
- `ServersViewModel.swift`: Handles server data fetching, sorting, and persistence.
- `Server.swift`: Model class for server data with SwiftData integration.
- `NetworkManager.swift`: Manages network requests with protocol-based mocking.
- `Tests`: Contains unit and integration tests for LoginViewModel, ServersViewModel, Server, and NetworkManager.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository:
   

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   

2. Install Dependencies:
   - This project uses native Swift and SwiftUI with no external dependencies. Ensure you have Xcode 15+ installed.

3. Open the Project:
   - Open Testio.xcodeproj in Xcode.

4. Build and Run:
   - Select a simulator or device and press Cmd + R to build and run.

5. Configuration:
   - No additional configuration is required. The app uses hardcoded credentials for the task.


## Design Notes

The UI is crafted to match the Figma design closely, with attention to:
- Layout and spacing defined in AppConfigurator.Sizes.
- Color scheme from AppConfigurator.Colors.
- Typography from AppConfigurator.Fonts.
- Animated logo effect implemented in AnimatedLogo component.

## Best Practices

- MVVM Architecture: Used for clean separation of concerns.
- Protocol-Oriented Programming: For network layer flexibility.
- SwiftUI: Leveraged for declarative UI with animations.
- Error Handling: Robust 401 response management.
- Test Coverage: High-quality tests for reliability.
